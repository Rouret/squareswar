# Game Client Architecture Documentation

This document outlines the architecture of the game client, following a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. The codebase is divided into layers to separate concerns, enhance modularity, and improve maintainability.

## 1. Overview

The game client is structured into four key layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Represents the core logic of the game, including player data, game state, and the domain rules.
- **Application Layer**: Contains the high-level logic such as managing events, movement, and player actions.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles external interactions such as WebSockets, input handling, and other system dependencies.
- **Presentation Layer**: Responsible for rendering the game state on the canvas and managing the user interface.

This structure adheres to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), ensuring that the business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns and UI rendering.
