# Game Server Architecture Documentation

This document outlines the architecture of the game server, following a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach. The codebase is divided into layers to separate concerns, enhance modularity, and improve maintainability.

## 1. Overview

The game server is structured into four key layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Represents the core logic of the game, including player data, game state, and the domain rules.
- **Application Layer**: Contains the high-level logic such as managing events, movement, and player actions.


This structure adheres to the principles of Domain-Driven Design (DDD), ensuring that the business logic is separated from infrastructure concerns and UI rendering.
